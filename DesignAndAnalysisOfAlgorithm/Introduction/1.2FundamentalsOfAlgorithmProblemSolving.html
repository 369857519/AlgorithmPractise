	//1.answer is binary
	//2.divide n by 2 then get remainder x and divisor y. x is the last bit of binary
	//3.if y=1 or y=0,add y to the bit of binary.assign n=y.goto 2

	//It's proving is also beautiful enough

	//1.2.10
	//1 you have to understand the problem
	//2 after understanding,then make a plan
	//3 carry out the plan
	//4 look back on your work

	//first they both need to define the problem
	//the plan is a more general description of algorithm
	//so make a plan and carry out it is same as design algorithm and coding it
	//look back is also same as ultimati
	//the difference is algorithmic problem solving is more vigorious
	//we need to analyzing and proving,it is much hader and specific
