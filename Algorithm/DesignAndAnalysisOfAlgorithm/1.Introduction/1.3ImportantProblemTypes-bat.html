	//a
		//we have four vertex v1,v2,v3,v4 and seven non-direction edges
		//two between v1 and v2
		//two between v1 and v3
		//one between v2 and v4
		//one between v3 and v4
		//one between v1 and v4
		//we need to traverse all the edges and return to the vertex which we are started from
	//b
		//no it doesn't have a solution
		//one new bridge will be required
		//I think if we want to traverse all the path and return, there must be at least (n-1)*2 edges
		//and there should be two edges between vertexs once they are linked

	//1.3.6
	//a
		//There are many factors should be considered exactly In real-life
		//1 best route should have the most reasonable price
		//2 spend least time
		//3 go through least miles 
	//b
		//first we should make stations as vertex
		//subway lines as edges
		//every edges has three weights of time,miles and price
		//then we found shortest way count by weights

		//a make every block as a vertice
			//if two neighbors are connected,they are linked. then we get a big map,and DFT this map and color it will be ok
